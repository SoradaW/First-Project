    <img src="appam.jpg" alt="appam" width="300" height="200">
    <p> Appam (also known as “palappam”) are tasty, lacy and fluffy pancakes or hoppers from the Kerala cuisine that are
        made from ground,
        fermented rice and coconut batter. Thin and crispy around the edges with soft fluffy center appam taste

    <h2>Lunch</h2>
    <img src="riceandcurry.jpg" alt="riceandcurry" width="300" height="200">
    <p> Rice and curry is a typical lunch in Sri Lanka. It is usually eaten on a banana leaf, which is not only very
        sustainable but provides lots of further nutrients! An entire morning
        can be spent on preparing this meal and lots of planning, organisation, time management and general skills are
        needed to pull this meal off. The great thing about this dish is that
        there is a variety of curries you can use; therefore there is something for everyone regardless of their diet
        and preferences. </p>

    <h2>Dinner</h2>
    <img src="dosa.jpg" alt="dosa" width="300" height="200">
    <p>A dosa is a thin pancake or crepe originating from South India, made from a fermented batter predominantly
        consisting of lentils and rice. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance,
        although savoury flavours are generally emphasized (sweet variants also exist). Its main ingredients are rice
        and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt,
        then fermented. Dosas are a common dish in South Indian cuisine, but now have become popular all over the Indian
        subcontinent. Dosas are served hot along with chutney by tradition and sambar
        in recent times. Other accompaniments include chutney powder (a fine groundnut and lentil powder)</p>

    <h2>Snacks</h2>
    <img src="vadai.jpg" alt="vadai" width="300" height="200">
    <p> Vada [vəɽɑː] (vaṛā) or bada [bəɽɑː] (baṛā)[7] is a category of savoury fried snacks from India. Different types
        of vadas can be described variously as fritters, cutlets, doughnuts, or dumplings.
        Alternative names for this food include wada, vade, vadai, wadeh and bara. In North India and Pakistan, Bhalla
        is a similar food. It is sold in chaat shops and kiosks; Green bean paste is added
        with spices, which is then deep fried to make croquets. They are then garnished with dahi (yogurt), Saunth
        chutney (dried ginger and tamarind sauce) and spices. Bhalla is usually served cold unlike the Aloo Tikki.
        The various types of vadas are made from different ingredients, ranging from legumes (such as medu vada of South
        India) to potatoes (such as batata vada of West India). They are often served as a breakfast item or a snack,
        and also used in other food preparations (such as dahi vada and vada pav).</p>

    <h2>Drinks</h2>
    <img src="falooda.jpg" alt="falooda" width="300" height="200">
    <p>A falooda is an Indian version of a cold dessert made with noodles. It has origins in the Persian dish faloodeh,
        variants of which are found across West, Central, and South Asia. Traditionally it is made by
        mixing rose syrup, vermicelli, and sweet basil seeds with milk, often served with ice cream. The vermicelli used
        for preparing falooda is made from wheat, arrowroot, cornstarch, or sago </p>
