            <p><span>Thailand</span> (ประเทศไทย), historically known as Siam, officially the Kingdom of Thailand, is
                a country in
                Southeast Asia. It is located at the centre of the Indochinese Peninsula, spanning 513,120 square
                kilometres (198,120 sq mi), with a population of almost 70 million people. Thailand is bordered to the
                north by Myanmar and Laos, to the east by Laos and Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and
                Malaysia, and to the west by the Andaman Sea and Myanmar. It also shares maritime borders with Vietnam
                in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast, and Indonesia and India (Andaman and Nicobar Islands) on the
                Andaman Sea to the southwest. Bangkok is the nation's capital and largest city. Nominally, Thailand is a
                constitutional monarchy and parliamentary democracy; however, in recent history, its government has
                experienced multiple coups and periods of military dictatorships.</p>

        <p> There’s nothing quite like a satisfying bowl of "Tom Yum Goong". This hot
            and sour shrimp soup is an explosion of flavour and is also said to have medicinal properties.
            Shrimps
            (goong) are an excellent source of protein and the vegetables pack in the vitamins. Chillies in the
            soup
            help to burn fat while lemongrass and lime both aid digestion and help to fight against colds. Treat
            yourself to a healthy serving of tom yum goong with this recipe. Add a side dish of jasmine rice and
            enjoy a taste of Thailand in your own home.</p>

    <div class="Foodinfo">
        <p> A classic Thai dish, Pad Thai, is sometimes referred to as the national dish of Thailand. A version of this
            noodle dish was thought to have been introduced to Thailand (then known as Siam)
            centuries ago by Chinese or Vietnamese traders. The local people then adapted it to their tastes with the
            addition of homegrown ingredients. But it was after the Second World War when the dish really gained in
            popularity across Thailand. In those post-war years, the production and sale of rice noodles was promoted by
            the Thai government as a patriotic venture and led to the humble noodle dish labelled Pad Thai.</p>

        <p> Green curry is probably the most pungent and spiciest of traditional Thai curries, yet its name literally
            means “sweet green curry”. It is said that the name actually refers to the color of the curry and not the
            taste. Indeed, in Thai, sweet green would refer to the “creamy green” or “pale green” color obtained by
            adding coconut milk to the green curry paste whose green color primarily comes from green chilies, and
            kaffir lime leaves. Thai green curry is typically served with rice, but it can also be served with
            traditional round rice noodles known as khanom chin. The fish sauce and the chicken or fish sauce can be
            omitted to make it a vegetarian green curry.</p>

    <div class="lists">
        <li> 1. Clean the chicken and pat dry with paper towel. Slice vertically into thin slices. Add 1 cup light
            coconut milk into a pot and bring to boil. Add chicken and reduce the heat to simmer the chicken until meat
            is tender. Dish out the chicken and set aside.</li>
        <li> 2. Add the vegetable oil into a pan and heat over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the curry paste and
            stir-fry until fragrant. Slowly add 1⁄2 cup of thick coconut milk and stir-fry until fragrant. Add chicken
            to the pan and stir-fry to evenly coat chicken in the curry paste. Remove pan from heat.</li>
        <li> 3. Transfer curry and chicken into a large pot and heat over medium heat. Add in 3 1⁄2 cups light coconut
            milk and kaffir lime leaves. Bring to boil then add fish sauce and sugar.</li>
        <li> 4. Add pea eggplant and make sure they are submerged in the curry. Continue cooking until eggplant is
            cooked through, then add the remaining 1⁄2 cup thick coconut milk. Bring to boil and add Thai basil leaves
            and red spur chillies.</li>
        <li> 5. Taste the curry and adjust the spiciness to your liking. If the curry is too spicy, add some coconut
            milk to bring down the heat level. Turn off the heat and remove from the stove. Dish out the curry into a
            bowl and garnish with Thai basil leaves. Enjoy with steamed rice or rice noodles.</li>
        <li> Tips:-</li>
        <li> When cooking the chicken, make sure the thin coconut milk is boiling before adding the chicken meat.
            This will tenderise the meat and remove any foul smell. The thin coconut milk that was used to boil the
            chicken should be discarded as it will contain a foul smell.</li>

    <div class="Foodinfo">
        <p> The classic Thai dessert known as Khao Niaow Ma Muang (mango sticky rice) is heavenly and scrumptious.
            Famously served as street food in Thailand and at Thai restaurants throughout the world, the taste of this
            tropical rice pudding is irresistible—and it's easy to make at home. This mango sticky rice recipe requires
            just a few ingredients. Use the ripest mangoes you can find, good-quality coconut milk (avoid "lite"
            options), and Thai sweet rice. Also called glutinous rice or sticky rice, it can be found at Asian food
            stores and well-stocked supermarkets.</p>

        <li> 1. Soak the sticky rice at least 3 hours or over night.</li>
        <li> 2. Cook the sticky rice by steaming for 20 minutes, turn the top over once after 10 minutes</li>
        <li> 3. While the rice is cooking, mix the rest of the ingredients together and microwave them for 30 seconds to
            one minute, but don’t let it boil. This is just to melt the granulated sugar and bring the mixture to a
            slightly warmer temperature. Don’t let the temperature pass over 120 degrees. It will make the grains of
            sticky rice too swollen and mushy and not as pretty. Leave it at room temperature and wait for the rice to
            be cooked. You need to do this BEFORE the sticky rice is cooked.</li>
        <li> 4. As SOON as the sticky rice is cooked, put it all in a bowl and pour the coconut milk mixture over it
            RIGHT AWAY. Stir until the sticky rice is all coated with the coconut milk mixture, then cover and let the
            sticky rice grains absorb the coconut milk. Leave it for 20 minutes. Don’t worry if it looks soupy at first.
            It should be. The coconut milk will be absorbed and dry afterward.</li>
        <li> 5. While you are waiting for the sticky rice to absorb the coconut milk, peel and cut the mangoes. Once the
            sticky rice is ready, serve them with mangoes.</li>

        <p> Just like much of South East Asia, it is hard to go around any market place in Thailand and not hear the
            sizzling sounds and delicious spicy smells of satay being cooked by stalls and street vendors. Such a simple
            dish can be both an entrée or a main. A dish of seasoned, skewered and grilled meat, usually served with a
            sauce. Its origins are from Indonesia and is popular in many other Southeast Asian countries including
            Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam.
            Satay can be anything from diced or sliced chicken, beef, pork, fish, prawn, other meats, or tofu grilled or
            barbecued over a fire (Or even just in a pan if in your kitchen) then served with various spicy seasonings.

    <div class="lists">
        <li>1. Stir coriander seeds and ground cumin separately in a pan till they start to change colour. (low heat as
            you don’t want to burn) this helps bring the aroma out.</li>
        <li> 2. Grind coriander seeds, in a mortar and pestle (or coffee grinder) with your ground cumin until very
            fine.
        </li>
        <li> 3. Add galangal, lemongrass in a mortar and pestle and grind together.</li>
        <li> 4. With your sliced meat in a mixing bowl add all the marinade ingredients and massage with your hand in
            glove (otherwise the turmeric yellow colour will stain your hand for 2 days), making sure that no pieces of
            meat are stuck together. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li> 5. Skewer the meat with bamboo skewers, and lay them flat on a tray.(don’t throw away the left over
            marinade)</li>
        <li> 6. Pre-heat your grill or pan to about medium as you don’t want to burn.</li>
        <li> 7. Pour the left over marinade you have into a tall glass and top up with coconut milk then dip your pork
            skewers into it before placing them onto grill/pan</li>
        <li> 8. Once cooking brush the other side with coconut milk and grill for a minute or so just until it is
            halfway
            cooked. Flip the skewers and grill the other side just until done.</li>
        <li> 9. You can serve the Satay skewers alone with Satay sauce or with a side of rice & Thai cucumber pickles.
